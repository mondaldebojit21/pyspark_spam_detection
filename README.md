# PySpark SMS Spam Classification

This PySpark notebook demonstrates a simple yet effective SMS spam classification model using PySpark, a powerful open-source data processing engine for big data analytics. The notebook utilizes the PySpark MLlib library to build and train a machine learning model that classifies SMS texts into spam or not spam.

## Introduction

SMS spam is a prevalent issue, and this notebook addresses it by employing PySpark to create a classification model. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages, enabling it to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `SMS_Spam_Classification.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment and run the cells sequentially.

## Model Training

The notebook guides you through the process of loading the dataset, preprocessing the text data, and training a PySpark MLlib classification model. It uses techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and logistic regression, RandomForestClassifier, or LinearSVC.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix is also generated to provide insights into the model's ability to classify spam and ham messages.

## Conclusion

This PySpark notebook provides a practical example of using big data tools for text classification. By leveraging PySpark's capabilities, it demonstrates how to build an effective SMS spam classification model.
